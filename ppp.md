## Overview

* Cover payroll and certain other recurring business costs over an 8-week loan period.
* Loan intended to support costs over an 8-week period after getting the loan.
* APR 1.00%, payments deferred 6 months, loan due in 2 years.


## Methodology to determine maximum loan amount

### Payroll costs

See _section f_, page 10 of `PPP--IFRN FINAL.pdf`.

* compensation to employees ... in the form of salary, wages, commissions, or similar compensation;
* cash tips or the equivalent (based on employer records of past tips or, in the absence of such records, a reasonable, good-faith employer estimate of such tips); 
* payment for vacation, parental, family, medical, or sick leave; 
* allowance for separation or dismissal; 
* payment for the provision of employee benefits consisting of group health care coverage, including insurance premiums,
* **payment of state and local taxes assessed on compensation of employees;**


### Excluded costs (applicable)

* $100,000 individual limit, annual.
* _Federal_ employment taxes imposed between 2/15/20 and 6/31/20, including income tax withholding, employee and employer FICA, etc. **NOTE** These amounts affect what comprises _payroll costs_ when it comes to accounting expenditures from the loan funds, they are **not** used to calculate the maximum loan amount (something paid in the future can't be excluded from a calculation based on payments paid in the past).
* Assuming EIDL and FFCRA are N/A.

### Calculation

  * [ ] Add up payroll costs for the **last 12 months**, e.g. 4/1/19 through 3/31/19. Call this `gross`
  * [ ] For employees receiving over $100K annually, add up the excess amounts and subtract from `gross`, call this `net of excess`.
  * [ ] Add up _federal_ tax withholding and total FICA for all employees for the period 2/15/20 through 3/31/20, subbract from `net of excess`, call this `net payroll`
  * [ ] Divide `net payroll` by 12 and multiply by 2.5 (or just multiply by 0.208). This is the maximum amount that can be borrowed (assuming no EIDL, etc).
